• Who am I as a professional? Check my [interactive resume builder](http://nexus-solutions.org/resume/)

• Who am I from my heart: Engineer on the DNA; as a little kid I looked how the remote controlled car worked instead of running it down the lawn. My passion for computers, smart devices and automation started since I was very young. 

Always finding a way to put a computer or a micro-controller into "**it**" so it works better. This had become my job and my biggest hobby. Today I can claim that I have helped a start-up grown into a [multi-billion dollar enterprise](https://rldatix.com/). Wearing many hats form back-end to front-end development to software architect, team leader to Research Software Engineer.
