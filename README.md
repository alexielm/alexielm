👋 Hi, I’m Alexiel Mejias

Who I am as a professional
I build solutions end-to-end — from architecture and backend services to front-end experiences. You can explore my interactive Resume Builder

Who I am at heart
Engineer in my DNA. As a kid, I was the one opening a remote-controlled car to see how it worked rather than driving it on the lawn. That curiosity turned into a lifelong passion for computers, smart devices, and automation.

I’m always looking for ways to put a computer or micro-controller into “it” so that it works smarter, faster, or better. That passion became both my job and my biggest hobby.

Over the years, I’ve helped a start-up grow into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise — wearing many hats:

Backend and Frontend Developer

Software Architect

Team Leader

Research Software Engineer
